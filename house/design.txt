1. Background
This project is for BioDS 253. We are tasked with using
the turtle graphics library in python to create a house.

2. Goals & Non-Goals
Our goals include:
- create a house with at 4 windows, 2 garage doors, one door, 2 trees, and 2 clouds.
- ensure tests exists for the core functions in the code for this house.

Non-Goals include:
- Making a program that will spit out a custom house with a user specified number of windows, doors, etc.
- Writing functions that can be used for different buildings such as a barn or skyscraper.


3. Design
We plan to organize the house symmetrically and write 2 core functions to draw lines and circles.
After testing, proceed to write functions that create shapes from lines and circles such as triangles,
rectangles, clouds, treetops. Finally, make compound structures such as windows and garage doors. Then,
write a function to make a house. Upload code and ensure dependencies are managed and readme file is
easy to read and understand.

4. Individual Contributions
Originally, Bikal completed the outline and design of the trees
and the house, including drawing specific aspects like the
windows and garage doors. Ryan worked on adding gray
clouds and tree leaves to the design. Sean added colors
to the house and trees.

During the project revision, Bikal created tests for the core
circle and line functions, edited out hard-coded numbers and
colors, rewrote the design document, created a new dependency
management file, and corrected Vijay's critisisms
of the code. Sean worked on the new ReadME file.
